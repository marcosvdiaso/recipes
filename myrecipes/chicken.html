            1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>
            1 teaspoon salt<br>
            1 teaspoon paprika<br>
            ½ cup seasoned bread crumbs<br>
            1 cup all-purpose flour<br>
            ½ cup milk<br>
            1 egg<br>

            <li> In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg. </li>
