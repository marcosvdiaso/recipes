        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        1¼ cups vanilla-flavored whey protein powder
        <br>1 cup whole wheat flour
        <br>1 teaspoon baking soda
        <br>1 teaspoon salt
        <br>1 cup unsalted butter, softened
        <br>¾ cup white sugar
        <br>6 tablespoons sucralose and brown sugar blend (such as Splenda® brown sugar blend)
        <br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        <br>2 large eggs
        <br>1 (10 ounce) bag chocolate chips
        <br>1 cup chopped walnuts (Optional)

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine whey protein, whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar substitute, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until creamy. Add eggs one at a time, mixing each one in fully before adding the next. Slowly beat in flour mixture. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts by hand.</li>
            <li>Drop tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 9 to 12 minutes. Let cool for about 2 minutes before removing cookies from the sheets and placing on cooling racks. </li>
